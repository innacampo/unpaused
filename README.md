Unpaused: Menopause & Sexual Health App

Unpaused is a dynamic web application designed to provide comprehensive educational resources on menopause and sexual health. The app offers a user-friendly interface to explore peer-reviewed scientific literature, take an interactive symptom quiz, and engage with a chatbot for quick answers.

The core of the application is built using React, with styling handled by Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean, responsive, and modern user experience. The content is written in Markdown and is dynamically rendered into formatted HTML using the marked library, making the app's educational material easily readable and accessible on any device.

This project was developed as a practical demonstration of how advanced AI models (Google Gemini 2.5) can significantly enhance and accelerate the creation of scientifically-driven educational application.
